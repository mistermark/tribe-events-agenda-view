The Events Calendar: Weekly View
======================

This plugin is a weekly event display for the plugin Events Calendar from Modern Tribe and based on the Agenda View.

It's supposed to be a good view for displaying weekly events instead of just showing the events as monthly view. Customized to fit my needs, but instead of keeping this for myself I'd rather share it.
